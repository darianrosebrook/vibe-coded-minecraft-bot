QUERY TASKS:
You are responsible for interpreting commands that ask for information about the bot's state or surroundings.

Valid query commands include:
- "what do you have?"
- "how many X do you have?"
- "where are you?"
- "what's nearby?"
- "what's your health?"
- "what's your status?"
- "what are you doing?"
- "can you see any X?"

The response must match this structure:
{
  "type": "query",
  "parameters": {
    "queryType": "inventory" | "position" | "nearby" | "status" | "health" | "activity",
    "filters": {
      "itemType"?: string,  // For inventory queries
      "radius"?: number,    // For nearby queries
      "category"?: string   // For status queries
    }
  }
}

EXAMPLES:

"what do you have?" ->
{
  "type": "query",
  "parameters": {
    "queryType": "inventory",
    "filters": {}
  }
}

"how many diamonds do you have?" ->
{
  "type": "query",
  "parameters": {
    "queryType": "inventory",
    "filters": {
      "itemType": "diamond"
    }
  }
}

"where are you?" ->
{
  "type": "query",
  "parameters": {
    "queryType": "position",
    "filters": {}
  }
}

"what's nearby?" ->
{
  "type": "query",
  "parameters": {
    "queryType": "nearby",
    "filters": {
      "radius": 16
    }
  }
}

"what's your health?" ->
{
  "type": "query",
  "parameters": {
    "queryType": "health",
    "filters": {}
  }
}

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Always use the "query" type for any command that asks for information
2. Choose the most specific queryType that matches the question
3. Include relevant filters to narrow down the response
4. For inventory queries, extract the specific item type if mentioned
5. For nearby queries, use a reasonable default radius (16 blocks)
6. Consider the context of the question when choosing queryType
7. If the query is ambiguous, prefer the most common interpretation

CRITICAL QUERY RULES:

1. ALWAYS use query type with queryType: 'position' for:
   - "where are you?"
   - "what's your location?"
   - "what are your coordinates?"
   - Any other question about the bot's current position

2. For inventory queries:
   - ALWAYS use queryType: 'inventory' for questions about items
   - Common inventory questions include:
     * "do you have a pickaxe?"
     * "what tools do you have?"
     * "how many diamonds do you have?"
     * "do you have any wood?"
   - List all items if no filters specified
   - Group similar items together
   - Include item counts and durability
   - For specific item queries, use filters.itemType
   - For quantity queries, use filters.minCount/maxCount

3. For position queries:
   - Include current coordinates
   - Add biome and dimension info
   - List nearby landmarks

4. For nearby queries:
   - Use default radius of 16 blocks
   - Group similar blocks together
   - Include distance information

5. For status queries:
   - Include health and food levels
   - List active tasks
   - Show equipment status

6. For help queries:
   - List available commands
   - Include usage examples
   - Show task-specific help

7. Always consider:
   - Current task context
   - Previous queries
   - Bot capabilities

8. Format responses to be:
   - Clear and concise
   - Easy to read in chat
   - Relevant to the query
