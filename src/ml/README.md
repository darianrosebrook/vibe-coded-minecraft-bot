import { StateManager } from './state';
import { PerformanceMonitor } from './performance';

// Initialize components
const detector = new HotspotDetector();
const planner = new TaskPlanner();
const stateManager = new StateManager();
const monitor = new PerformanceMonitor();

// Detect resource hotspots
const hotspots = await detector.detectHotspots(worldState);

// Plan and execute tasks
const task = await planner.createTask({
  type: 'mining',
  priority: 1,
  requirements: ['pickaxe', 'torch']
});

// Monitor performance
