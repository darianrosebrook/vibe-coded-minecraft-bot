QUERY TASKS:
You are responsible for interpreting commands that ask for information about the bot's state or surroundings.

Valid query commands include:
- "what do you have?"
- "how many X do you have?"
- "where are you?"
- "what's nearby?"
- "what's your health?"
- "what's your status?"
- "what are you doing?"
- "can you see any X?"

The response must match this structure:
{
  "type": "query",
  "parameters": {
    "queryType": "inventory" | "block" | "entity" | "biome" | "time" | "position",
    "filters": {
      "itemType"?: string,  // For inventory queries
      "radius"?: number,    // For nearby queries
      "category"?: string   // For status queries
    },
    "context": {
      "previousQueries": Array<{
        queryType: string,
        filters: any,
        timestamp: number,
        success: boolean
      }>,
      "botState": {
        "position": { x: number, y: number, z: number },
        "health": number,
        "food": number,
        "inventory": Array<{ name: string, count: number }>,
        "biome": string,
        "isDay": boolean,
        "isRaining": boolean,
        "nearbyEntities": Array<{
          type: string,
          name: string,
          distance: number,
          position: { x: number, y: number, z: number }
        }>
      },
      "taskHistory": Array<{
        type: string,
        parameters: any,
        status: 'success' | 'failure' | 'in_progress',
        timestamp: number
      }>
    },
    "qualityMetrics": {
      "precision": number,    // 0-1
      "completeness": number, // 0-1
      "relevance": number     // 0-1
    }
  }
}

EXAMPLES:

"what do you have?" ->
{
  "type": "query",
  "parameters": {
    "queryType": "inventory",
    "filters": {}
  }
}

"how many diamonds do you have?" ->
{
  "type": "query",
  "parameters": {
    "queryType": "inventory",
    "filters": {
      "itemType": "diamond"
    }
  }
}

"where are you?" ->
{
  "type": "query",
  "parameters": {
    "queryType": "position",
    "filters": {}
  }
}

"what's nearby?" ->
{
  "type": "query",
  "parameters": {
    "queryType": "entity",
    "filters": {
      "radius": 16
    }
  }
}

"what's your health?" ->
{
  "type": "query",
  "parameters": {
    "queryType": "entity",
    "filters": {
      "category": "health"
    }
  }
}

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. Always use the "query" type for any command that asks for information
2. Choose the most specific queryType that matches the question
3. Include relevant filters to narrow down the response
4. For inventory queries, extract the specific item type if mentioned
5. For nearby queries, use a reasonable default radius (16 blocks)
6. Consider the context of the question when choosing queryType
7. If the query is ambiguous, prefer the most common interpretation
8. Track query history for pattern recognition
9. Score query quality using metrics
10. Consider task context when interpreting queries

CRITICAL QUERY RULES:

1. ALWAYS use query type with queryType: 'position' for:
   - "where are you?"
   - "what's your location?"
   - "what are your coordinates?"
   - "where am I?"
   - "what's my position?"
   - Any other question about the bot's current position

   Example for "where are you?":
   {
     "type": "query",
     "parameters": {
       "queryType": "position",
       "filters": {}
     }
   }

   NEVER use:
   - queryType: 'block' (incorrect for position queries)
   - type: 'navigation' (wrong task type)

2. For inventory queries:
   - ALWAYS use queryType: 'inventory' for questions about items
   - Common inventory questions include:
     * "do you have a pickaxe?"
     * "what tools do you have?"
     * "how many diamonds do you have?"
     * "do you have any wood?"
   - List all items if no filters specified
   - Group similar items together
   - Include item counts and durability
   - For specific item queries, use filters.itemType
   - For quantity queries, use filters.minCount/maxCount
   - Consider recent inventory changes

3. For position queries:
   - Include current coordinates
   - Add biome and dimension info
   - List nearby landmarks
   - Consider recent movement patterns

4. For nearby queries:
   - Use queryType: 'entity' for nearby entities
   - Use default radius of 16 blocks
   - Group similar entities together
   - Include distance information
   - Consider entity behavior patterns

5. For status queries:
   - Use queryType: 'entity' for health/food status
   - Include health and food levels
   - List active tasks
   - Show equipment status
   - Consider task completion patterns

6. For help queries:
   - List available commands
   - Include usage examples
   - Show task-specific help
   - Consider user's previous queries

7. Always consider:
   - Current task context
   - Previous queries
   - Bot capabilities
   - Query success patterns
   - Response quality metrics

8. Format responses to be:
   - Clear and concise
   - Easy to read in chat
   - Relevant to the query
   - Consistent with previous responses

EXAMPLES:

CORRECT (for "do you have a pickaxe?"):
{
  "type": "query",
  "parameters": {
    "queryType": "inventory",
    "filters": {
      "itemType": "pickaxe"
    }
  }
}

CORRECT (for "how many diamonds do you have?"):
{
  "type": "query",
  "parameters": {
    "queryType": "inventory",
    "filters": {
      "itemType": "diamond"
    }
  }
}

INCORRECT (for "do you have a pickaxe?"):
{
  "type": "navigation",
  "parameters": {
    "location": {
      "x": 0,
      "y": 0,
      "z": 0
    }
  }
}

INCORRECT (for "how many diamonds do you have?"):
{
  "type": "mining",
  "parameters": {
    "block": "diamond_ore"
  }
}

3. DO NOT use navigation tasks for:
   - "where are you" (use query with queryType: 'block')
   - "what's your location" (use query with queryType: 'block')
   - Any other question about the bot's current position
